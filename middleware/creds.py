"""Upstream header assembly.

Headers are a transparent passthrough: every agent header is forwarded
unchanged. The proxy invents nothing (no User-Agent / Content-Type / Accept of
its own). Two exceptions:
  1. client-owned headers (Host, Content-Length, ...) are dropped so httpx sets
     them correctly — the body length changes when we merge `include`.
  2. credentials (Authorization, chatgpt-account-id) follow the auth mode, with
     the token / account id supplied directly from config.toml `[auth]`.
